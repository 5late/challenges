# Challenges

Weekly challenges for each team.

## How it works:

- Fork the repo
- Under today's day, create a folder with your username in the solutions folder
    - Example: `advanced/days/example/solutions/slate/`
- In your folder, put your source code. There should be only one file, and it should be named with your github username.
- Make sure the file ends in `.py`
- Open a pull request, once most people have their PR's merged, the answer will be uploaded and the leaderboards will be automagically created.
