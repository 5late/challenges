# Day 0 -The First Challenge

## Welcome to Day 0

Hello and welcome to day 0. As a part of our intermediate team, you have been hand picked by our top agents to perform a series of top-secret missions.

You will join the Administrative Control Force (ACF), where you will work on important projects.

As part of the ACF, you will be exposed to extremely sensitive material. It is **vital** that you do not expose this information to others.

Recently, an important scientist and innovator has gone missing. He was last seen near an abandoned mine. This scientist handled many innovations that would improve human life, and it is imperitave that we locate him.

## Mission

Your mission today is simple. With the information we have, print the AREA and PERIMETER of the abandoned mine.

## Mission Resources

- [Variables & Data Types](https://github.com/MWCSC/documentation/blob/master/python/0-variables-data-types.md)
- [Print Function](https://github.com/MWCSC/documentation/blob/master/python/01-print-function.md)
- [In-Built Math Functions](https://github.com/MWCSC/documentation/blob/master/python/02-inbuilt-math-functions.md)

## Information:

- Rectangle shaped
- All the measurements are given
- Find the area and perimeter of the rectangle

## Values:

- Width: 5698
- Length: 10254

## Expected output format:

- **Integer values** (no decimals, no rounding)
- Area on first line
- Perimeter on second line
- No units or words, just the numbers
- No trailing newlines

Example:

```
12
15
```
