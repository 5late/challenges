# Day 0 - The First Challenge

## Welcome to Day 0!

Hello and welcome to day 0. As part of the advanced team, you have been hand picked by our top agents to perform a series of top-secret missions.

You will join the Classified Intelligence and Securities Service (CISS), where you will work on the highest tier of projects.

As part of the CISS, you will be exposed to extremely sensitive material. It is **vital** that you do not expose this information to others.

We have word that a global superpower has been building an underground bunker where they plan to harbor criminals. It is imperative that we locate this bunker and destroy it before it becomes operational.

### Mission

Your mission today is simple. With the limited information we have, print the AREA and PERIMETER of the underground bunker.

### Mission Resources

- [Math Functions](https://github.com/MWCSC/documentation/blob/master/python/02-inbuilt-math-functions.md)
- [Import Doc](https://github.com/MWCSC/documentation/blob/master/python/08-import-and-libraries.md)
- The math module
- `math.sqrt()`

### Information:

- The bunker is a RIGHT ANGLE TRIANGLE
- We have the measurements of 2/3 of the sides of the base
- We do NOT have the measurement of the hypotenuse


### Values:

Measurement 1: 2546375247 metres
Measurement 2: 45987482082 metres

### Expected output format:

- **Integer Values** (no decimals, no rounding)
- Area on first line
- Perimeter on second line
- No units or words, just the numbers
- No trailing newlines

Example:

```
12
15
```
